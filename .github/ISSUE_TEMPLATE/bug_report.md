## Feature requests

We use issues for tracking bugs. If you'd like to request a feature, create an "idea" discussion instead. Be sure to look through existing ideas to see if there's something similar. If you find a similar idea show that it's important to you by voting for it (↑).

## Duplicates

### Expected behavior

### Actual behavior

### Steps to reproduce

### Suggested solution?

<!--
  Do you have any ideas on how we could fix this?
  It is okay if you don't!
-->

### What version of `emery` are you running?

<!--
  We will only look into issues that are effecting the latest version.
-->

### Demo

<!--
Please provide an example to show the issue. Here is a boilerplate to help you get started:
https://codesandbox.io/s/yi0jp5

- If you paste a big block of code it can be difficult to debug.
- Issues without demo's may not be investigated.

<!--
## Note: stale issues will be removed

When a maintainer asks a question about an issue and it is not responded to within a reasonable time frame then the issue will be closed. We don't want this to happen — but we also do not want to accumulate stale issues.
